User Stories:
as a user :
1- I want to guess a 5-letter word by clicking letters on an on-screen keyboard, so I can interact with the game intuitively.

2- I want my guessed letters to appear on a grid with five tiles per row, so I can see my guesses clearly as I make them. 

3- I want the letters in my guess to change color based on their correctness (green for correct, yellow for misplaced, gray for incorrect), so I can know how close I am to guessing the word.

4- I want the game to prevent me from entering invalid words, so I don't waste guesses on words that don't exist.

5-  I want the game to display animations when I reveal the letters, so the game feels more interactive and fun.

6- I want the game to give me six guesses, so I have enough chance to win the game.

7-  I want the on-screen keyboard to reflect the status of the letters I've used (correct, misplaced, incorrect), so I can track my guesses visually.

8-  I want feedback (win/lose) after my attempts, so I know if I successfully guessed the word or failed after 6 attempts.

9- I want the game to give me some kind of hint, so I can guess the word.
