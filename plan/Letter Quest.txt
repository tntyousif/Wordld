User Stories: 

as a user: 

1- I want to guess a 5-letter word by clicking letters on an on-screen keyboard, so I can interact with the game intuitively. 

  

2- I want my guessed letters to appear on a grid with five tiles per row, so I can see my guesses clearly as I make them.  

  

3- I want the letters in my guess to change color based on their correctness (green for correct, yellow for misplaced, gray for incorrect), so I can know how close I am to guessing the word. 

  

4- I want the game to prevent me from entering invalid words, so I don't waste guesses on words that don't exist. 

  

5- I want the game to display animations when I reveal the letters, so the game feels more interactive and fun. 

  

6- I want the game to give me six guesses, so I have enough chance to win the game. 

  

7- I want the on-screen keyboard to reflect the status of the letters I've used (correct, misplaced, incorrect), so I can track my guesses visually. 

  

8- I want feedback (win/lose) after my attempts, so I know if I successfully guessed the word or failed after 6 attempts. 

  

9- I want the game to give me some kind of hint, so I can guess the word.

**Game pseudo code** 

  

1- game steps 

Define five letter words, Randomly select one Worde from the list as the guessed word, display a hint related to the word, display empty six rows of five column grid for the guesses, display a keyboard on-screen with all the 26 characters, initialize variables to track the current guess and the state of the keyboard (correct, mis-placed, wrong) 

  

2- user interaction: 

When the user clicks on a letter on the keyboard if the current guess is less than five letters, add the clicked letter to the current guess, update the display to show the guess on the grid. 

  

3- letter reveal: 

Compare each letter of the guess to the secret word, if the letter is in the correct position, color the tile green, if itâ€™s in the secret word but mis-placed, the tile color will change to yellow and mark the letter as present on the keyboard, if the letter is not in the secret word the tile color will be gray. 

 

4- End of Game Conditions: 

If the guess matches the secret word, display a message (You Win!) and the game end. 

If the user has made six guesses without guessing the word, display (You Lose! The word was: [secret word]) and end the game. 

 

6- post Game: 

Provide an option for the user to restart the game ("Play Again/Restart" button), which resets the grid, selects a new secret word, and clears the keyboard status.
